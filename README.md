# csv_expoter

## This is a program which can convert a .csv file into a list of SQL statements in a .txt file which can be used to import the data into the database.

## The .csv file should be saved in the folder with the name "export.csv" and the SQL Queries will be stored in "queries.txt" file. However, according to the data in .csv file as well as column names in SQL Table, the C++ struct and functions needs to be modified.

## This project was created for importing the Articles into the database as a part of my co-op project.
